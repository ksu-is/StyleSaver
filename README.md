## Related Repository Inspiration
This project was inspired by **[Money Manager](https://github.com/)** by David, a Python-based expense tracking program that organizes and visualizes spending categories.  

The *Money Manager* project focuses on budgeting and expense tracking, which closely aligns with *StyleSaver*’s financial management features. However, *StyleSaver* extends this concept by incorporating **AI-powered fashion recommendations** and **real-time budget alerts**.

## Notes
StyleSaver will be completed by one individual rather than a team collaboration.
